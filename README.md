# Basic-Java-Projects
I created this repo when I was in my second semester of my second year in university as a student of mathematics and computer science.
I specifically created it to help my fellow students to learn more about programming basics and also to grasp what they may not have been taught in class.
This series is mostly based in C and Java because they are among the commonly used languages to help students understand programming basics.
Hope this helps every student that will go through it.
